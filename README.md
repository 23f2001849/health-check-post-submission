## Project Overview
The Simple Health Check web application is a minimalistic tool designed to simulate a system health check. With its straightforward and user-friendly interface, it randomly generates a system status as either healthy or unhealthy. The application serves as a prototype for monitoring system health in a more complex application. It can be used in various contexts, from server health checking to assessing the status of various hardware or software components in a system. The purpose of this application is to provide a reliable, albeit simplified, idea of how a health checking system might function, giving developers a starting point for developing more complex health check systems.

## Requirements
The project doesn't have any specific evaluation criteria, but the provided HTML file should be complete and self-contained. It should include all CSS in style tags and all JavaScript in script tags. The code should be professional and production-quality, with a responsive design that can be achieved using Bootstrap 5 or custom CSS. The application should also include proper error handling and comments for complex logic.

## Installation & Setup
To install and set up the Simple Health Check web application, follow these steps:

1. Download the HTML file for the web application.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to run the application locally.
3. To host the web application on a server, upload the HTML file to the server's public HTML directory.
4. To access the web application from the internet, navigate to the server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.
5. The web application doesn't require any additional setup or configuration.

## Usage Instructions
Using the Simple Health Check web application is straightforward. 

1. Open the web application in a web browser.
2. The application will automatically perform a simulated health check and display the result.
3. A "System is healthy" message indicates that the simulated health check passed.
4. A "System is unhealthy" message indicates that the simulated health check failed.
5. To perform another simulated health check, refresh the web page.

## Technical Details
The Simple Health Check web application is a single-page application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn't rely on any external libraries or frameworks. The application uses a basic random number generation to simulate a health check, representing a binary healthy or unhealthy system status. The CSS styles are embedded in the HTML file, and the JavaScript code is contained within a script tag in the HTML file.

## Troubleshooting
If the Simple Health Check web application isn't working as expected, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check that the HTML file is correctly formatted and doesn't contain any syntax errors.
2. Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser.
3. If the health check result doesn't change, remember that the result is randomly generated and may occasionally produce the same result consecutively.
4. If the application still doesn't work, consider seeking help from a web development professional or community.
